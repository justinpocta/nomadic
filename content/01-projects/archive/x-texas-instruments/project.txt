Text: While wrapping up my time in Dallas to move out to New York, I got to work alongside coworkers with a large internal team at Texas Instruments. These are the kind of really smart people who are think up brilliant solutions using crazy technologies and then have to help you try and grasp what exactly they're talking about.

One of the projects I was involved in was rethinking the UX and UI of their existing software. This is a sort of puzzle that involves the careful act of balancing a *massive* companies' existing and necessary pieces with your own ideas that ask "But why?" and "Can we somehow reduce this?" There are often complex reasons something is the way it is and you have to navigate your way through the weeds to work with everyone to find the best solutions.

Add math into that equation (how I kept getting picked *me*, of all people, for math-related projects, I don't know) and you have yourself a massive jigsaw. Fortunately, we had some great folks to work with who had lots of answers for us.

The following images show some approaches I took to help quiet down the background in appropriate modes, organize the toolsets, and coordinate with parallel projects' design directions.

Slideshow mode allowed to skim through the lesson step-by-step, with nicely enlarged graphs to show from desktop or via projector, which we found was common and pointed to helping reduce the brightness of elements the teacher is not discussing during lecture.

Many menu items also needed some polishing to give teachers access to managing classes and students without having go through tedius navigation buried in levels of dropdown menus.
