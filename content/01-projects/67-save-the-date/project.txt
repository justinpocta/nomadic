Text:
This was a fun personal project that hilariously has been copied at least a few times&mdash;thank you, Pinterest. After a few rounds of nice designs, I realized that I wasn't capturing the quirkiness of my brother and my soon-to-be sister-in-law. Rather than a design about them, I decided to create something a bit different and pulled out my dSLR and nice inky pen.

Nov 2013 Update - A third family member is on the way, so we decided to celebrate the only way we know how. (Temporary) face tattoos.
