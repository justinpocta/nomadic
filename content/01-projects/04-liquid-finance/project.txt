Text: Liquid was definitely one of the heaviest projects I worked on while at [x]cube. I'm not a math guy, but had to wrap my head around this project in every way. Our developers were not based in my office, so I had to take details from client meetings and help explain our goals to help them then guide me, as both producer and designer, through proper development options.
