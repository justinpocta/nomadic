In early Spring 2011, I was honored with the opportunity of designing the invitation for the DSVC 2011 Dallas Show.

One of the challenges I had to solve was finding a way to mail a 3-dimensional box which married in the Show's casino related theme. The process had to be fairly agile as I began without having confirmation about the type of cutting techniques that would be available to me. I was excited when they got connected with a lasercutting because&mdash;C'mon! Lasers?

This was another project where I got to work with some great folks who helped guide me along their expert paths and let me run with my role in the creative.

The project has been featured on (link: http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2012/1/13/dallas-show-invitation.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheDieline+%28TheDieline.com+-+Blog+-+World%27s+%231+Package+Design+Website%29 text: The Dieline) and (link: http://www.underconsideration.com/fpo/archives/2012/02/dallas-society-of-visual-communications-invitation.php text: FPO).
