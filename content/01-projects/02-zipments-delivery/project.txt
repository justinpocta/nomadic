Text: After my first few months at Zipments, where we poured a lot of time into reworking the web app and marketing site, the team agreed it was high time to extend our platform into the mobile space. The website excelled at many things for desktop users, but we knew mobile tools could help customers continue to explore our service in powerful ways.

We put a good deal of effort into the website's request process to make it quick and dare I even say fun? With that, we knew native mobile capabilities could only help further our tool's benefits for non-office use cases, and extend Zipments to more markets, such as with on-the-go professionals like event planners and photographers. We knew this could also be an extremely easy to integrate opportunity for boutiques and other small shops without laptop and wi-fi connections.

Our team had the work cut out for ourselves as we were targeted the release to be within a month alongside ongoing web app updates (because that's what startup folks like to do&mdash;not sleep)! Within a short time span, I worked with the CEO and Co-Founder/Developer to consider what features to prioritize and think out how these features could be implemented powerfully but quickly, so we could get feedback from users sooner.

<div class="detail-description">The app led us to create features that would actually come back around to influence the main website, such as Address Book which allows users to sync contact info for easy repeatable deliveries.</div>

<div class="detail-description">
While the app was made to help users request deliveries, it also was aimed to be useful to monitor delivery already posted and in progress. Peace of mind for business people running around with enough anxiety on their plate.
<br><br>
One of the aspects we really tried to hammer down in the website was a set of easy to recognize and select icons representing package types. This fit very nicely into a touch environment.</div>

<div class="detail-description">
After selecting a type, you simply input how heavy and how many of that type. From there you can add another or move to the next step.
<br><br>
Adding lots of details about dropoff and pickup locations is probably the biggest pain point due to the amount of typing. The Address Book not only needed to be its own entity, but a tied in feature that works with users as they go through the delivery request process by allowing you to Save to Locations as you go. In the future, you just hit Add from My Locations and you're set.</div>

<div class="detail-description">
We found that mapping can be a bit of a pain in New York, where Avenue vs. Street can mean missed delivery timeframes. To help alleviate this, we provide a visual to allow the user to know that what they typed is what they meant.
<br><br>
Pricing was a good challenge. We had to dynamically provide costs based on the users' input information which all is interconnected to draw up the right number. Here we really wanted to provide a helpful, direct quote and clarity about timing to make the experience as pleasant as possible.</div>

<div class="detail-description">
A nice final tally to confirm we have gotten everything needed down properly. A nice breath of fresh air to help the courier industry take out hidden costs which frustrate customers and the experience of hunting down numbers and calling around to get a quote.</div>
