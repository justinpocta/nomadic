Text:
This was a project that I really loved working my way through. A very iterative project as there were lots of album names being tossed around, songs still being written in the middle of the design process&mdash;all while I was in the middle of my senior year. But despite the moving pieces, I fortunately worked alongside other creatives who could express what we were trying to accomplish and who gave me a lot of creative freedom to do what I do best. It is also boosts things forward when great folks are pushing out a project they are deeply excited about and cannot wait to share with others.

This is one of the more illustrative graphics I had dealt with in awhile and one that I enjoyed piecing together with my own photography I needed to shoot to make this work just right.

The record contains a lot of songs that discuss in a raw, honest way the doubts and wrestling one goes through trying to grasp ideas of spirituality in the physical realm, where emotions and trials sit on your shoulder. I really appreciated the topic, as it felt true to real life where daily life is never simple as it appears on the surface.
